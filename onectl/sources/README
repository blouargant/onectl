Needed packages:
python-argparse

Bash completion:
 Needs onectl.bash in /etc/bash_completion.d/
 then add "source /etc/bash_completion.d/onectl.bash" to /etc/bashrc


to display the content of onectl:
tree --dirsfirst -I '*pyc|*~|*.backup'



To go from NCAP's desc syntax to normal python:
append "self.directive_" to the special command.
Exemple 1:
	info "Display that text"
becomes
	self.directive_info("Display that text")

Exemple 2:
	mkdir /this/directory
becomes
	self.directive_mkdir("/this/directory")
